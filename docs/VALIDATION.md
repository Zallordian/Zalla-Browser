# Validation and release gates

## Status
Source includes find-on-page (system find navigator via the browser menu) and native JavaScript alert/confirm/prompt panels (WKUIDelegate). These still need Mac/simulator validation with live pages.

Source review and file checks only on Windows.
 Native compilation, XCTest, visual verification, and device privacy tests have NOT been run. Do not treat this milestone as a tested binary.

## First Mac session
- Generate project, compile the app and tests; resolve all errors and investigate warnings.
- Run AddressResolverTests: empty input, HTTPS inference, explicit HTTP, query encoding, and executable/unsupported schemes.
- Browse HTTPS and HTTP pages, enter a search, follow same-window and target-blank links; verify redirects, back/forward, reload, stop, offline errors and invalid certificates.
- Switch tabs; verify each keeps its own page and back stack. Close selected/background/last tabs.
- Visit a distinctive URL in private mode, close the tab, relaunch; verify it never appears in history or the library file. Check private cookies do not persist or cross to regular tabs.
- Bookmark a page, relaunch, remove it; verify persistence. Force a storage failure and verify the error surfaces.
- Clear browsing data after setting cookies. Confirm tabs close, site login ends, history clears, bookmarks remain, and no pages recreate cookies in the background.
- Share a page; test Mail, Messages, Files and installed apps. Test telephone/email confirmation and cancellation. Arbitrary custom URL schemes are currently unsupported.
- Check app-switcher snapshots from both regular and private tabs on a physical iPhone.
- Test VoiceOver, large Dynamic Type, light/dark, keyboard, rotation, smallest supported iPhone screen, and low-memory behavior.

## Website location (Build 16)
Needs a physical iPhone. Check: Ask prompts once per site and remembers Allow and Don't Allow; Never blocks with no prompt; a private tab asks every time and a second visit asks again; Settings, Privacy, Location lists answers and swiping one away makes the site ask again; Reset the App and Burn It All clear the list; iOS Location Services off or While Using denied for Zalla leaves sites without a position and the page not hanging; behavior on iOS 17 to 26 (WebKit's own prompt) versus iOS 27 (Zalla's prompt).

## Required before public beta
JavaScript alert/confirm/prompt support, downloads, file upload and system credential validation, camera/microphone permissions, memory management, content-process recovery, restoration policy, meaningful connection security UX, and explicit handling of unsupported content. Add targeted tests as these behaviors are implemented.

## Required before App Store submission
TestFlight feedback, final product scope, StoreKit sandbox tests if an upgrade ships, accurate privacy label/policy, app icon/screenshots, developer signing, supported SDK review, default-browser capability approval if included, support contact, and licensing review for any bundled rules or assets.
